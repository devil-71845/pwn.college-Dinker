# MATERIALS CHEMISTRY - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. INTRODUCTION TO POLYMERS

### Definition and Terminology

-   **Polymer**: Derived from Greek words "poly" (many) and "meros"
    (parts)
-   Giant molecules formed by combination of several simple molecules
    with two or more binding sites linked through covalent bonding
-   **Monomers**: Simple repeating units of the polymer
-   Example: Polythene formed from ethene molecules

### Degree of Polymerization (DP)

-   **Definition**: Number expressing the total number of repeating
    units (n) in the polymer chain
-   **High polymers**: Large number of repeating units
-   **Oligomers**: Lower number of repeating units
-   **Usage**: DP is used to determine molecular weight = n × molecular
    weight of repeat unit

### Functionality

-   **Definition**: Total number of functional groups, bonding sites, or
    reactive sites present in the monomer
-   **Reactive functional groups**: -OH, -COOH, -NH₂, -SH, -NCO

**Examples:** - CH₃CH₂OH → one -OH group → monofunctional -
HO-CH₂-CH₂-OH → two -OH groups → bifunctional -
HOOC-CH₂-CH(COOH)-CH₂-COOH → three -COOH groups → trifunctional

**Double/triple bonds**: Presence imparts polyfunctionality - Ethylene
with double bond can take on two atoms of hydrogen or halogens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. CLASSIFICATION OF POLYMERS BASED ON MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

### 2.1 Linear Polymers

**Structure**: Long, unbranched chains of monomers linked in a straight
line

**Representation**: M-M-M-M-M-M

**Examples**: Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)

**Properties:** - High strength and stiffness (chains can align and
crystallize) - Good resistance to solvents and chemicals - Relatively
high melting and glass transition temperatures

**Applications**: Packaging, textiles, engineering plastics

### 2.2 Branched Polymers

**Structure**: Main linear backbone with additional side chains or
branches attached

**Examples**: Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), Polyisobutylene

**Properties:** - Lower densities and lower crystallinity than linear
counterparts - Improved flow properties (easier to process and mold) -
Better impact resistance and flexibility (due to disrupted chain
packing)

**Applications**: Film manufacturing, packaging

### 2.3 Network (Cross-linked) Polymers

**Structure**: Linear or branched polymer chains chemically connected at
various points, creating 3D network

**Examples**: Vulcanized rubber, Epoxy resins, Polyurethane, Hydrogels

**Properties:** - Highly resistant to solvents, heat, and chemicals -
High strength, toughness, dimensional stability - Relatively inflexible
and insoluble

**Degree of cross-linking effect:** - High cross-linking → more rigid
and brittle - Lower cross-linking → greater flexibility and elasticity

**Applications**: Tires, coatings, adhesives, composite materials

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF POLYMERS

### 3.1 Strength

**Based on Forces of Attraction:**

1.  **Straight chain and branched chain polymers**:
    -   Held together by weak intermolecular forces
    -   Strength increases with chain length (molecular weight increase)
    -   Mechanical strength achieved if chain length \> 150-200 carbon
        atoms
    -   Less than this → soft, gummy, brittle at low temperature
    -   Intermolecular forces increased by introducing polar groups
        (carbonyl, hydroxyl)
2.  **Cross-linked polymers**:
    -   Held together by covalent forces
    -   Greater strength than straight and branched chain

**Based on Slipping Power:**

-   **Definition**: Movement of molecules over each other

**Examples:** - Polyethylene: Simple, uniform → high slipping power →
lesser strength - PVC: Bulky chlorine atoms along chain → restricted
movement → low slipping power → higher strength - Cross-linked: Movement
totally restricted (covalent bonds) → strong, rigid, tough

### 3.2 Plastic Deformation

-   **Definition**: Permanent shape deformation when subjected to stress
    (heat or pressure or both)
-   **Importance**: Helps in moulding of plastics

**Behavior:** - Linear molecules: High slippage (weak intermolecular
forces) → greatest plastic deformation - At high pressure/temperature:
van der Waals forces weaken - Cross-linked: No slippage (strong covalent
bonds) → total destruction if excessive force applied

### 3.3 Crystallinity

**Amorphous vs Crystalline:** - **Amorphous**: Completely random
arrangement of molecules - **Crystalline**: Regular arrangement of
molecules

**Factors for crystallization:** - Linear chains without branching - No
bulky substituents - Closely arranged parallel to each other - Held
together by van der Waals forces, H-bonding, or polar interactions

**High crystallinity characteristics:** - High tensile strength - High
impact and wear resistance - High density - High fusion temperature -
Sharp softening point - Greater strength and rigidity

**Examples:** - Polystyrene: Long repeating unit/low symmetry → forms
amorphous structure - PVC, Polypropylene: Crystalline structure

### 3.4 Chemical Resistance

**Solubility principles:** - Polymer more soluble in structurally
similar solvent - Polar groups (OH, -COOH) → dissolve in polar solvents
(water, alcohol) - Non-polar compounds (hydrocarbons) → dissolve in
non-polar solvents (benzene, toluene)

**General rules:** 1. Solubility decreases with increasing molecular
weight 2. High molecular weight polymers → high viscosity solutions 3.
Crystalline polymers → higher resistance than less crystalline 4.
Greater crystallinity → lesser solubility

**Practical importance**: Drug storage in plastic bottles requires
chemical resistance to prevent drug-polymer interactions

### 3.5 Elasticity

**Mechanism**: Uncoiling and recoiling of molecular chains upon force
application

**States:** - **Unstretched elastomer**: Irregularly coiled and
entangled (amorphous state) - **Stretched state**: Snarls disentangle
and straighten (crystalline state) - Observable: Opaqueness and warmth

**Criteria for elastic nature**: - Individual chains should not break
even after prolonged stretching - Achieved by: Introducing suitable
cross-linking, allowing non-polar groups or side groups

### 3.6 Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)

**Definition**: Temperature below which an amorphous polymer is brittle,
hard, and glassy; above which it becomes flexible, soft, and rubbery

**Behavior at different temperatures:** - **Below Tg (Glassy state)**:
No molecular or segmental motion → rigid solid - **Above Tg (Rubbery
state)**: Segmental motion possible but molecular mobility disallowed →
flexible

**Effects on different polymer types:** - **Crystalline/amorphous
thermoplastic**: Behave differently after Tg - **Thermosetting**: Little
effect from heating; destroyed at high temperature

**Factors Affecting Tg:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factor                 Effect                 Example
  ---------------------- ---------------------- -------------------------
  **Chain geometry**     Regular geometry →     Polyethylene: Tg = -110°C
                         high Tg                (no bulky groups)

  **Polar groups**       More polar groups →    Nylon 6: Tg = 50°C
                         high Tg                (H-bonding)

  **Molecular weight**   Increase MW → higher   Not significant if MW ≈
                         Tg                     20,000

  **Crystallinity**      Crystalline → higher   Strong H-bonding in
                         Tg than amorphous      crystalline

  **Plasticizers**       Addition → reduces Tg  Dibutyl phthalate,
                                                diacetyl phthalate
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Importance of Tg:** - Helps choose right processing temperature -
Measure of flexibility - Indicates thermal expansion, heat capacity,
electrical and mechanical properties

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF POLYMERS

### Number Average Molecular Weight (Mn)

**Definition**: Total mass of all molecules divided by total number of
molecules present

**Formula**: Mn = Σ(NᵢMᵢ) / ΣNᵢ

Where: - Nᵢ = number of molecules with molecular weight Mᵢ - Mᵢ =
molecular weight of species i

### Weight Average Molecular Weight (Mw)

**Definition**: Sum of fractional masses each molecule contributes
according to ratio of its mass to whole sample

**Formula**: Mw = Σ(NᵢMᵢ²) / Σ(NᵢMᵢ)

### Polydispersity Index (PDI)

**Definition**: Ratio of weight average to number average molecular
weight

**Formula**: PDI = Mw / Mn

**Interpretation:** - **PDI = 1**: Monodisperse system (all molecules
equal length) - **PDI \> 1**: Polydisperse system (molecules of varying
sizes)

**Typical values:** - Natural proteins: PDI ≈ 1 - Synthetic polymers:
PDI = 1.5 to 5

### Worked Examples

**Example 1**: Calculate Mn, Mw, and PDI

Given: 1, 2, 3, 4 molecules with MW: 10⁵, 2×10⁵, 3×10⁵, 4×10⁵

Solution: - Mn = (1×10⁵ + 2×2×10⁵ + 3×3×10⁵ + 4×4×10⁵)/(1+2+3+4) =
3.0×10⁵ - Mw = \[(1×10⁵)² + (2×2×10⁵)² + (3×3×10⁵)² + (4×4×10⁵)²\] /
\[1×10⁵ + 2×2×10⁵ + 3×3×10⁵ + 4×4×10⁵\] = 3.3×10⁵ - PDI = 3.3×10⁵ /
3.0×10⁵ = 1.1

### Determination by Viscometry

**Mark-Houwink Equation**: \[η\] = KMᵃ

Where: - \[η\] = intrinsic viscosity - M = molecular weight - K and a =
constants for particular polymer-solvent-temperature system

**Graphical method**: - Plot log\[η\] vs log M → straight line -
log\[η\] = log K + a log M - Slope = a, Intercept = log K

conducting polymers - Contain delocalized electron pairs or residual
charge in backbone - Conjugated π-electrons responsible for electrical
charge - Examples: Polyacetylene, Polyaniline, Polypyrrole,
Polythiophene - **Conductivity**: 10⁻¹⁰ Ω⁻¹cm⁻¹ (low, undoped)

**2. Doped Conducting Polymers:**

**a. p-doping** (oxidation): - Treatment with Lewis acid - Creates
positive charges on polymer backbone - Common p-dopants: I₂, Br₂, AsF₅,
PF₆⁻, naphthylamine - Process: Removal of electrons → polaron (hole
between valence and conduction bands) → bipolaron (two positive charge
carriers) - Delocalized charge carriers conduct when in electric field

negative charges on polymer backbone - Common n-dopants: Li/Na
naphthalene, sodium naphthalide

**3. Extrinsically Conducting Polymers (ECPs):**

conducting elements (carbon black, metallic fibers, metallic oxides) -
**Percolation threshold**: Minimum concentration where polymer starts
conducting

**b. Blended conducting polymers**: - Combining conventional polymer
with conducting polymer - Better physical, chemical, electrical,
mechanical properties - Easier processing - Example: Polyacetylene +
thermoplastic polymers composite

chains

**Key parameters:** - **LCST (Lower Critical Solution Temperature)**:
Dissolve at lower temps, insoluble as temp rises - **UCST (Upper
Critical Solution Temperature)**: Dissolve at higher temps, lose
solubility at lower temps

**Examples:** - LCST: Poly(N-vinyl amide), Poly(N-substituted
acrylamide), Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam), Cellulose, Chitosan,
PLGA-PEG-PLGA triblock copolymers - UCST: Poly(2-dimethyl
methacryloxyethyl-ammonium propanesulfonate)

**Applications:** - Drug delivery (release medication at specific body
temperatures, e.g., during inflammation) - Smart textiles (change
breathability or color with environmental temperature)

### Electro-Responsive Polymers (EAPs)

**Mechanism**: Convert electrical energy into mechanical energy

**Changes**: Reversible shape changes (swelling, shrinking, bending)

**Three main mechanisms:**

1.  **Conductivity Change**: Doping alters electronic structure → makes
    polymer conductive

2.  **Electrostriction**: Change in shape/size when electric field
    applied

3.  **Ion Migration**: Ions move within material → swelling,
    deformation, conductivity changes

**Applications:** - Actuators and artificial muscles (robotics, mimic
natural muscle movements) - Smart windows and coatings (change
transparency, properties based on electrical inputs)

### Photo-Responsive Polymers

**Mechanism**: Undergo changes when exposed to light

**Primary mechanism - Photoisomerization:** - Chromophores switch
between two forms (isomers) when exposed to specific wavelengths -
Example: Azobenzene (switches between cis and trans upon UV or visible
light exposure) - Result: Macroscopic changes (bending, stretching,
optical property changes) - Reversible process

**Applications:** - Smart coatings (change color or hydrophobicity in
response to light) - Soft robotics and actuators (move or change form
via light, allowing remote control)

### Definition

Atomistic deposition processes where material is vaporized from
solid/liquid source as atoms/molecules, transported as vapor through
vacuum/low pressure environment to substrate where it condenses

### Process Description

1.  Material placed in energetic, entropic environment → particles
    escape surface
2.  Facing source is cooler surface → draws energy from particles →
    forms solid layer
3.  System kept in vacuum deposition chamber → particles travel freely
4.  Films deposited are directional rather than conformal

**Typical film thickness**: Few nanometers to thousands of nanometers

**Typical deposition rates**: 10-100 Å/s

### Vacuum Evaporation Method

ion beam) in high vacuum chamber (10⁻⁵ torr or less) 2. Dislodges atoms
from target surface, vaporizing them 3. Vaporized atoms move in straight
path to substrate 4. Metal atoms deposit on substrate surface 5.
