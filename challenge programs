# Challenge programs
The actual files comprising the challenge live in the /challenge directory. Unlike previous challenges, 
which automatically ran when the terminal was opened, this challenge requires you to invoke the /challenge/solve program directly! 
Just by running it in a terminal, you will get the flag!

## My solve
flag:pwn.college{wvEw-AFcnFPSFnpygohpQUVFqqj.QX0MDO0wiM2gjNzEzW}

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible.. Use triple ticks for bash.
```bash
example triple ticks for bash
pwn.college{helloworld}
```

## What I learned
  To access the file from the directory using dojo for the first time

## References 
I refered a video about Getting started in Interacting with DOJO from pwn.college.
